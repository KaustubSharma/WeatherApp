# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Technologies Used

## HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It defines the structure of content on a web page using elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS is used for styling HTML elements, allowing developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a web page. It enables the separation of content from presentation, making websites more flexible and easier to maintain.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile programming language commonly used in web development. It allows developers to add interactivity, dynamic behavior, and logic to web pages. With JavaScript, developers can create features like form validation, animations, and interactive maps.

## React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of an application efficiently. React uses a component-based architecture, making it easier to develop complex web applications by breaking them down into smaller, manageable pieces.
